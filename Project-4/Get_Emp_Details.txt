Req : - Create an integration to get employee details as request payload and generate a CSV file based on this employee data and send over the mail.


Sol: 
 Create App-Driven Integration using REST Adapter having trigger connection.
Stage File - to create the file
Notification - send an email


===== Create a request JSON  Payload ====

{
	"RequestData":
[
{
	"Name" : "Alex",
	"DOB"  : "01-01-2000",
	"Role" : "IT-Security",
	"DOJ"  : "05-11-2024" 
},

{	"Name" : "Alex",
	"DOB"  : "01-01-2000",
	"Role" : "IT-Security",
	"DOJ"  : "05-11-2024"
} 
]
}

Now we will create sample file so that OIC take the reference of that sample file to create CSV file.

Create CSV sample file so that OIC will take this--
Name, DOB,Role,DOJ,CreationDate,CreatedBy,IntegrationName
Alex,19-03-2025,IT,19-03-2025,19-03-2025,XYZ,XYZ


== Response Payload ===

{
	"Status" : "Success/Error",
	"FileName" : "xyz.csv"
}

--------- Create App driven 
Give name - Stage_DEMO_01 
Package name - abc
Add the trigger connection which we already created now configure --
Endpoint name - StartRest
Enpoint's URI - /generateFile
Operation - POST
Check both option of configure a request payload and receive the response - next
Drag the JSON Request Payload
Drag the JSON Response Payload in configure Response page
Continue and finish 

For creating the file -- 

It is better to create variable 

Assign it after Trigger conn 
Name - default assign 
Var_FileName = 'XX_EMP_001.csv' -- to generate the file we use this name

For creating the file in OIC we have Stage File (Write File)

Want to call ur action? - WriteFile_Stage
Choose stage file operation - Write File
File name - drag var_FileName
O/p directory - '/temp'
Continue -- 
Drag the sample file 
Enter the record name - RN
Enter the recordSet Name - RSN
Rest option we can keep the same
Continue and finish
Then click on MAP to WRITE_FILE_STAGE
Request Wrapper to response map them 
Created Date -- use current_date function by creating a target node 
OIC instance ID
Created by -  - Integration metadata details - Runtime details- Invoked by
Integration name -Integration metadata details  - Integration name

Validate it and go back

Now the stage file that is created it will return file reference in repsonse - file is already created and they will give link of the file
